# GGR472 Lab 3 by Kevin Yuan

This repository contains the Lab 3 website, documents used to create the website, and data it used. 

## Repository Contents
For this lab, I created an interactive map showing the Toronto Subway Line 2, including line, station, transfer information and the line portion that is still under construction. I also added several interactive features to the map. 

## Data
I created 4 .geojson files for this map, including:

- `line2completed.geojson`: completed portion of line 2.
- `line2incompleted.geojson`: incompleted portion of line 2.
Both are line features, displaying in green line on the map.
- `stations_completed.geojson`: completed stations.
- `stations_incompleted.geojson`: incompleted stations.
Both are point features, displaying in either black or red points on the map.



Inside both point features, I added both station names and transfer informations.
